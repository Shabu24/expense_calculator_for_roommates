"🏠 A friendly Python rent calculator that splits bills fairly between roommates—with emojis and personality! No math fights, just clear shares. 
# 🤝 Meet Your New Favorite Roommate  

This isn’t one of those boring "enter numbers, get output" tools. It’s like texting a friend who’s weirdly good at math:  

**How it feels to use:**  
1. You: *"Ugh, bills are due..."*  
2. Calculator: *"Hey! Let’s sort this out together 👋"*  
3. You: *[answers simple questions]*  
4. Calculator: *"Done! You owe ₹1,200 (and btw, your electricity bill is sneaky high ⚡)"*  

**No setup needed**—just Python and your bills.  

👉 **Try it now:**  
```bash
python rent_calculator.py
